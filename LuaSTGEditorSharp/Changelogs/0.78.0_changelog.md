## LuaSTG Editor Sharp X - 0.78.0
## Features

* New node: "Protected call". Just a "pcall" node accepting children nodes.
* New node: "Render Animation". There was "load animation" so why not render.
* Added a remote template github repo: Those templates can be downloaded via the "New File" window when you create a new project. There is an option to disable those in the settings.
* Added a log system. The log will save under "editor.log" in the main editor folder. Please send this log if you're experiencing issues so we can help debug them.

## Changes

* Added a "last = " prefix to the set stage background node.
* Revamped the "About" window.
* Added *.glb files in the model file selector.
* BREAKING: Add File node now support multiple files separated by a `|` character. This might break compability with some files. If this happens, delete and recreate the node.

## Fixes

* Fixed indentation for the "set smooth value" node.
* Fixed Simple Bent Lasers.
* Fixed "3d" view mode being defaulted to "3D".
* Fixed the "Play BGM" node (Thanks OLC).
* Fixed the Rotation attribute window being set to "Color" in the "Create Simple Laser" node.
